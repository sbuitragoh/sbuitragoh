## Hi, I'm Santiago üëã

I'm a Python developer with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Though I'm open to explore new tools and technologies, I'm focused mainly in python and data analysis.

### ‚ú® Project Approach

I like to approach projects with practical and results-oriented mindset. My areas of interest and the type of projects I've worked on include:

* **Data Analysis and Processing:** Applying tools like **Pandas an NumPy** to clean, transform and process data.
* **Automation:** Creating scripts that automate or simplify different tasks.
* **Exploring New Technologies:** I'm always open to learning and applying new libraries, frameworks, or paradigms, especially in the fields of **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.
